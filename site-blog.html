                <p>5/26/25:</p>
                <p>if it isn‚Äôt obvious, i‚Äôm not a web dev. i just wanted to make something cute 
                    (i‚Äôm using ‚Äúcute‚Äù in the broadest sense imaginable) but something ab all the lines, 
                    or the divs in divs‚Äîwhich give wayyy too much structure for my liking‚Äîwtv it is, 
                    it‚Äôs not me. its giving corporate kawaii üíÄ serious sanrio üíÄ                     
                </p>
                <p>if i got a do-over id do something like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/10061442-Eminem-%D0%97%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%A5%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8B-2005/image/SW1hZ2U6Mjc4MDM4OTE=?redirected=true">this</a></li>
                    <li> lots of bright colors</li>
                    <li>i‚Äôd do either green x black x chrome</li>
                    <li>or green x brown for a more laid-back feel</li>
                </ul>

                <p>my eyes r hurting from all the pink and everything looks so flat. 
                    i think i need to add some texture and shadows... i'll feel much better once that's done
                </p>
                <p>i also think making an authentic maximalist design in a way that would please my own standards 
                    requires a vision i‚Äôve yet to acquire. i suppose prototyping in figma or canva would help, 
                    but im just typing in html n hoping for the best‚Ä¶ tbh most designs tday r 
                    minimalist  cuz it's "functional" but i think websites should be a proper experience,
                    not just a means to an end. also, the clean look is ubiquitous cuz its harder to do maximalism well.
